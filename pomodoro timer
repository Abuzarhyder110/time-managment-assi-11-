# Pomorodo Timer: Create a program that implements the Pomodoro Technique (25 minutes work, 5 minutes break). Use a loop and if statement to track time intervals and notify
# the user when to switch between work and breaks.

     time.sleep(WORK_DURATION)

     print("Take a 5 minute break.")
     time.sleep(BREAK_DURATION)
